# Toronto Neighbourhood Population Census vs Crime Data

## Extraction

#### Data Sources:
- Toronto Neighbourhood 2016 Census of Population: https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/en_AU/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles
  Data Format: CSV file

- Toronto Neighbourhood 2016 Crime Data: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/neighbourhood-crime-rates-boundary-file-/geoservice?geometry=-80.421%2C43.542%2C-78.335%2C43.890&orderBy=Hood_ID
  Data Format: GeoJSON file

## Transformation

From 2016 Census of population, Hood ID and Age population spectrum were extracted and a dataframe was created.

Toronto 2016 crime data was extracted from the GeoJSON api source and required keys were selected to create a dataframe. 

Data was parsed/cleaned. A connection to the SQL postgres was made.

## Loading to Database
SQL schema was created with the required keys for both the table in pgAdmin.
The databases were loaded through jupyterâ€™s notebook and then connected and transferred to pgAdmin for easier merging and browsing.

By merging the two tables together, we are hoping to discover; 1), which neighbourhood is more
prominent in crime and 2) if there is a relation between crime rate and the age demographic.
